From this arises unconscious knowledge linking us through our ancestral heritage (see Jung report, pg. 12\u201334). Through this collective unconscious, we unknowingly attribute a series of images and archetypes to all elements of our lives. These archetypes are never fixed, but shift and change in tandem with our species and culture.<br>\n<br>\nThis internal belief in the power of images, shared by a massive population, is <b>[REDACTED]</b> in the creation of <a href=\"/wiki/Altered_Item\" title=\"Altered Item\">Altered Items</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Object_of_Power\" title=\"Object of Power\">Objects of Power</a>. The sheer amount of <b>[REDACTED]</b> exuded is attracted to the best representation of that image, imbuing a single object with massive amounts of <b>[REDACTED]</b>.<br>\n<br>\nTheoretically, <a href=\"/wiki/Place_of_Power\" title=\"Place of Power\">Places of Power</a> could likewise be formed by the simple power of sustained, collective belief.<br>\n<br>\nRefer to file 5-41-7532 for full report.\n</p>",

Its purpose and function are currently unknown.<br>\n<br>\nThe specific shape and dimensions of the Atlas (see file ATL-03 for said dimensions) seem to indicate a more explicit purpose than the Oldest House's usual walls, floors, or shifts. The Atlas changes form, but resists observation when doing so. No visual observation has been made during its change, and it only ever occurs between frames when monitored by surveillance cameras.<br>\n<br>\nA previous theory was that this change corresponds to <a href=\"/wiki/Shift\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shift\">House Shifts</a> and that the Atlas is a <b>[REDACTED]</b> of the <b>[REDACTED]</b> itself. However the shape changes do not occur at the same time as the building shifts, which makes this theory doubtful.<br>\n<br>\nStructurally the Atlas is made of the same <b>[REDACTED]</b> material as the rest of the Oldest House. Further observation will hopefully aid in discovering its purpose.<br>\n<br>\nRefer to file 8-37-3592 for full report.\n</p>",

My predecessor, <a href=\"/wiki/Theodore_Ash,_Jr.\" title=\"Theodore Ash, Jr.\">Dr. Ash</a>, theorized that a potential receptacle (determined by Jungian archetypes and the collective subconscious) would be inhabited by <a href=\"/wiki/Paranatural\" title=\"Paranatural\">paranatural</a> energies when an <a href=\"/wiki/Altered_World_Event\" title=\"Altered World Event\">AWE</a> occurred in its vicinity, creating an <a href=\"/wiki/Altered_Item\" title=\"Altered Item\">Altered Item</a>. Over time, a link was created by the <b>[REDACTED]</b> and the Astral Plane to that item, making it an Object of Power.<br>\n<br>\nSo many additional theories have been raised since Dr. Ash's time. Objects of Power were placed on Earth as tests by some Astral entity. Our dimension was once part of the Astral Plane, and the Objects were left behind as its borders receded. The Astral Plane was an early <a href=\"/wiki/Threshold_(location)\" title=\"Threshold (location)\">Threshold</a> into the <a href=\"/wiki/Oldest_House\" title=\"Oldest House\">Oldest House</a>, but the connection was severed and now the two are linked solely through the Objects of Power.<br>\n<br>\nI will attempt to disprove some of these in order to thin the herd.
