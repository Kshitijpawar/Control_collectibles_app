Like I said, I want to talk about <a href=\"/wiki/Jesse_Faden\" title=\"Jesse Faden\">Jesse</a>, your sister.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: What about her?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: I just want to get your perspective. What do you think of her? What kind of person is she? That sort of thing.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: I adored my sister. When I was little, I mean. Back in <a href=\"/wiki/Ordinary\" title=\"Ordinary\">Ordinary</a>.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: And you don't anymore?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: When I first got here, sure. I'd always hope she'd come too. To find me. To take me home. We went everywhere together, why should this be any different? <a href=\"/wiki/Casper_Darling\" title=\"Casper Darling\">Casper</a> said she could come too, to the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control\" title=\"Federal Bureau of Control\">Bureau</a>, if she wanted to. But she never did.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Why do you think that is?<br>\n<br>\n[Dylan, under his breath, unsubtitled: <i>Oh, come on.</i>]<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Because she didn't care about me. She always wanted to be out on her own, seeing the world. She always said so. I guess she got what she wanted.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Great. So she wanted to see the world. Did she ever mention any place in particular?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Why?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: We like to ask questions around here, you know that. Any particular cities, towns, landmarks, anything like that?<br>\n<br>\n[Dylan scoffs]<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: I don't remember.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: What about family friends? Were you close with anyone living outside of Ordinary?<br>\n<br>\n[Dylan stands up]<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: I'm done with this. Tell Casper I want pizza for lunch today.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Dylan, wait, we're not-<br>\n<br>\n[slamming noise]<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: End of session.\n</p>",

The questions asked here correspond to the fifth iteration of the Gunnars Psychological assessment. Are you ready, Dylan? Let's begin then. In a single word, describe the world around you.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Where's <a href=\"/wiki/Casper_Darling\" title=\"Casper Darling\">Casper</a>?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Dr. Darling is out of the building today.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: He's never out. He didn't want to come, did he? He never visits, not since <span class=\"new\" title=\"Roberts (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUm9iZXJ0cz9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Roberts</span>. Tell Darling it wasn't my fault. I couldn't control it yet. But I can now. I learned. Will you tell him?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: In a single word, describe the world around you.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: A prison. A cold, empty prison. Not even a poster on the wall.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: What is the next number in the sequence: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: 18.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: What day is it today?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: How the hell would I know? It's not like you give me a calendar.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: You find a rabbit in the woods. It is breathing, but not moving. You cannot see any blood. What do you do?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Leave it.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Expand on that.<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: It doesn't matter. The rabbit's not real. None of it's real.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: What day is it today?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Do you enjoy asking people questions that can't be answered? Is this what gets you up in the morning? What you dreamed of doing as a scared, stupid little girl?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Can you describe a dog to me?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: In <a href=\"/wiki/Ordinary\" title=\"Ordinary\">Ordinary</a>, we had a friend. <a href=\"/wiki/Neil_Hosenberg\" title=\"Neil Hosenberg\">Nosebleed Neil</a>. And when it all went crazy, you know what I mean, Nosebleed Neil turned into a dog. Or something like a dog.<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: What day is it tomorrow?<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Fuck off! I don't know! There. Is. No. Calendar! How could I fucking know?<br>\n<br>\nCARLA: Dylan, calm down-<br>\n<br>\nDYLAN: Fuck you! Fuck you and fuck Casper! Hey, are you watching this, you old fuck?!

I looked the poem up... only I could not find any poet by that name. I did find a European filmmaker who moved here in the sixties, named Thomas Zane.<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: What? I don't...<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: No matter. It suits you very well, the poem. How you see things. Maybe you wrote it yourself?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: I didn't...<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: No matter. You've said a few times that you feel like \"there's a piece of you missing.\" Can we talk about that?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: Okay. Yeah. it's this... I feel... an emptiness, a yearning for something that I think I lost.<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: It is natural for you to feel that way. Your brother and your parents are dead.<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: No. No... <a href=\"/wiki/Dylan_Faden\" title=\"Dylan Faden\">Dylan</a>'s not dead. And... that's not even it.<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: You are referring to the imaginary friend from your childhood.<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: <a href=\"/wiki/Polaris\" title=\"Polaris\">Polaris</a>... she's come back, after a long time. She's calling me... in a dream I saw. She showed me things.<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Jesse.<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: It felt more real than anything. As real as what happened in <a href=\"/wiki/Ordinary\" title=\"Ordinary\">Ordinary</a>.<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: The industrial accident in your home town? ...that you believe \"Polaris\" caused?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: No, it wasn't an accident. There was no \"industrial accident.\" And Polaris didn't cause it. She saved me and Dylan.<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Jesse...<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: No. It was a cover up. <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control\" title=\"Federal Bureau of Control\">The government</a> knows about it. There were agents there. Agents from... I don't know exactly. They took Dylan. They... I'll find them. I won't stop looking. Polaris wants me to go to New York. There's a... <a href=\"/wiki/Oldest_House\" title=\"Oldest House\">building</a> there. I have to leave soon. I have to be there at a very specific time. Something... something hugely important is going to happen-<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Jesse, you know we can't let you go until you're well.

Things that have been thrown away. Did you ever feel that way when you were growing up, Jesse?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: What? No... yes, but that has nothing to do-<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Was there a slide projector at your home, when you were small?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: No...<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Those were before your time, I suppose. But your family did look at photos together maybe, in one form or the other?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: Maybe...<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Hmmm... when was this, can you remember? At parties, barbecues? How did it make you feel? Did your parents ever show pictures that embarassed you? Was alcohol ever involved at these parties? Did your parents drink? Did that make you uncomfortable?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: No! That's just stupid. Come on. That has nothing to do with this. Nothing. The Slide Projector-<br>\n<br>\nPSYCHIATRIST: Let me ask you this: as a child, did you ever fantasize about worlds inside pictures. Inside a painting? You know, stepping into a painting, into a hidden world, escaping, and finding adventures there? Away from your parents?<br>\n<br>\nJESSE: I don't... I don't think so, I don't remember. Maybe. I don't know.\n</p>",

A mailman drives a truck full of packages down an endless American neighborhood as a pack of rabid dogs chase behind. Now these dogs are nothing like my mom's\u2013 my stepmom's corgi, Chuck. These were some real nightmare hellhounds.<br>\n<br>\n[Dog bark sound effect]<br>\n<br>\nBRIAN: The dogs keep pace with the mail truck, tearing chunks out of the driver's legs and arms. Each package he throws out the door is marked by his bloody handprint. He screams in pain and confusion, and this goes on and on until the movie just abruptly ends. There aren't even any credits, which is a pretty bold choice. Is this film a commentary on how our 9\u20135 jobs are killing us, or how hostile the modern world is to outdated concepts like mailmen? Perhaps it's merely a statement about the futility of purpose, and<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[subs 1]</a></sup> how no task can ever be really done. There are lots of ways to interpret it, but for now let's get to the part you're all waiting for. It's score time!<br>\n<br>\n[Cheering and \"score\" announcer sound effect]<br>\n<br>\nBRIAN: I give this film a four out of five, only because the actor frequently broke the fourth wall\u2013 by looking into the camera and shouting at it, like he was shouting at the audience. A little too on the nose for me. But I did enjoy it and I recommend you check out other films produced by <a href=\"/wiki/%22Blessed%22_organization\" title='\"Blessed\" organization'>Blessed Pictures</a>. \"Bike Hard\" and \"Coffee Bullet\" are the only others I\u2019ve found, but this little art house studio certainly knows how to push the boundaries of Western cinema.<br>\n<br>\n[Wolf whistle sound effect]<br>\n<br>\nBRIAN: And a friendly reminder that there will be no new episode next week as I will be visiting my aunt in Delaware for Thanksgiving. Thanks for listening, all you Brian fans. And remember, we all love movie-magic, but don't forget about the you-magic. Until next time!<br>\n<br>\n[Podcast outro: \"Movie Den. Brian's Movie Den.

I was in room 47. The night manager, an avid listener of the program, insisted I take this particular room. Now, the manager explained that, years back, the body of a man was discovered under the bed, inside that wooden border that motel beds tend to have. The body had been there a week, he said. Guests had stayed there, sleeping with the corpse a foot below them. They only found the body when housekeepers complained about the smell. Hauntings have been reported in room 47 ever since. I happily took the room. I fell asleep pretty quick, checking under the bed first of course. No ghosts visited me. No chilly spots or flickering lights. But when I woke up, I found myself under the bed. It was dark and stiflingly hot. Luckily I was able to push the mattress off and crawl out before I suffocated. The Night Manager was kind enough to find me another room.<br>\n<br>\nRADIO HOST: There you have it, listeners. What we call ghosts take many forms. Quincy was brave enough to tell his story. And I encourage you to keep calling and writing whenever you encounter something strange. Something you can't explain. Maybe you're seeing colors that we have no name for. Maybe your toaster is possessed. Remember, dear listeners, when no one else believes you, we do. America Overnight will be right back.<br>\n<br>\n[America Overnight theme]\n</p>",
