It began with visceral dismemberment scenes, and this great unsettling vibe created by the unexplained creature they named \"the Fix\".<br>\n<br>\nAs an avid horror fan, I loved how this story veered from the genre conventions into something a little more, for lack of a better word, weird. Everything felt familiar, but just a little off. The characters even comment on it, saying how their lives felt out of control, as if they were just programmed to perform the same empty actions over and over. Very meta.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I loved the way they left the ending wide-open. What happened to the guy ordered to watch those monitors for the rest of his life? Did the Fix get him? Is he dead? Did he end up in the parallel reality with the others? We don't know. And that's okay.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all an interesting read. I'll give it a solid 4/5. Points deducted for some of the clunky dialogue and unbelievable choices the characters made. I mean, who the hell would follow orders from their boss in the middle of such horrible slaughterfest? But I guess I shouldn't demand too much realism from a work of fiction.\n</p>",

The title \"<a href=\"/wiki/Unless_You\" title=\"Unless You\">Unless You</a>\" could refer to a bunch of things in the book, I guess, but I thought it was a little vague and stupid. The way the characters kept throwing it around almost like a catchphrase got real annoying real fast.<br>\n<br>\nThe best part of the story was the space battles. I sided with the Fixers, obviously, because they had the coolest tech and their motives made the most sense to me. Honestly, if I had to choose between some hoity-toity flowers-in-guns space hippies or a bad- ass bunch of warriors who go around devouring planets like cheap sushi on a Sunday, I know who I'm picking. That scene where they invade city-planet and convert the entire population using those brain worms? And that space dog fight between those two ace pilots? Sign me the fuck up.<br>\n<br>\nWhat kind of ruined the whole thing for me was when my favorite character got killed not even halfway through the story by getting a battery cylinder launched into his face by a <a href=\"/wiki/Floppy_Disk\" title=\"Floppy Disk\">gravitational anomaly</a>.

Lopez</a><br>\n<br>\nThese days, most YA novels intertwine the \"coming of age\" story with either a contrived dystopian setting or a tragic romance. \"Unless You\" managed to do both.<br>\n<br>\nIn the story, the protagonist and her love interest search for a cure to a virus called \"the Fix\", which is simultaneously killing her and spreading across the whole world. To find the cure, they go on expeditions into dangerous, uncharted territories (the people all live in walled cities now because dystopian future), and along the way they just have to fall in love.<br>\n<br>\nI liked how we never got to know if the Fix was ever actually... fixed. The ending was bold, especially for YA. The main character succumbs to the Fix when she's so close to the cure and commands her love interest to go on and save the world. She knows this is the end for her, but that the job can still get done. She dies out in the unknown, alone and surrounded by danger, but never loses sight of the goal. That's a good soldier's death.<br>\n<br>\nI give this book 3/5. I feel most of the teenage angst is a little lost on me, but I'd recommend it to my brother's kids.\n</p>",
