It was faint. Reaching for her from a <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_Place\" title=\"Dark Place\">dark place</a>. Faden was sensitive to visitations. She had them all the time. From her <a href=\"/wiki/Polaris\" title=\"Polaris\">guiding star</a>. And the <a href=\"/wiki/Zachariah_Trench\" title=\"Zachariah Trench\">previous director</a>. She was the perfect receiver. As if she'd been made for this.<br>\n<br>\nFaden paused to feel it. The force at play here. It was changing things around her. Subtle. Trying to make her act. Faden didn't like that. Her guide felt it too. Polaris didn't flare up in defense as she'd done with <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hiss\" title=\"The Hiss\">the Hiss</a>. So it wasn't all bad. Not a hostile transmission. It was powerful but it was coming from far away. And made weak because of the distance. It was a distress call. Faden sensed a <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Wake_(character)\" title=\"Alan Wake (character)\">drowning man</a>. A man desperate to escape. She sensed something else too. A <a href=\"/wiki/Emil_Hartman\" title=\"Emil Hartman\">hunger</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_Presence\" title=\"Dark Presence\">dark</a>. Not unlike the hostile resonance. Waiting. She knew that desperate acts can have grim consequences. It was this, more than the man's despair, that made her follow the call.<br>\n<br>\nThe elevator lights winked back on. The darkness receded like a memory. There was a new button on the elevator control panel: \"<a href=\"/wiki/Investigations_Sector\" title=\"Investigations Sector\">Investigations Sector</a>.\" Faden pressed the button. The elevator doors slid shut with practiced bravado.\n</p>",

The <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control\" title=\"Federal Bureau of Control\">Federal Bureau of Control</a> had stolen his life's work. This was his last chance, his final experiment, what he'd been too scared to do before. Hartman dove into the <a href=\"/wiki/Cauldron_Lake\" title=\"Cauldron Lake\">lake</a>. Was taken. Devoured by <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_Presence\" title=\"Dark Presence\">hungry darkness</a>. Became the Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman. Only an echo of him remained. Fragmented impulses on autoplay. Violent, bloodthirsty darkness in the driver's seat. Emerging from the lake, the Thing was captured by the FBC. Brought in. Contained. Studied. The Thing broke loose. Killed everyone it could. The FBC fell back and sealed the <a href=\"/wiki/Investigations_Sector\" title=\"Investigations Sector\">sector</a>. The Thing was alone in the dark. Lurking. Roaming. Waiting.<br>\n<br>\nThen <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hiss\" title=\"The Hiss\">something else</a> came. Not darkness. But similar enough. A sound. A resonance. It shouldn't be a surprise. If there's one, why not another. The darkness inside the Thing could've been immune. Could have resisted. Fought. Could have been passed by, passed through, with no effect. But it didn't and it wasn't. Maybe it had grown weaker over time. Not aged. It was timeless. But weaker with no link to its source. A metamorphosis followed. The Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman went through another change.\n</p>",

Balance Slays the Demon. A couple of others. Three massive stadium-sized gigs. The old men rocked like they were possessed by the devil. Like their namesakes. The backstage parties got out of hand. The air was thick with smoke. Wheeler squinted. His migraine flared. Booze and drugs. A rock \u2018n\u2019 roll clich\u00e9. They ran off after every gig. Wheeler had security track them down to the craziest afterparties. The Andersons were so old. Vampires. Princes of fucking Darkness. After every gig and the rampaging party that followed it took them weeks to bounce back. And they never did completely. Each time, Wheeler expected them to croak. It was that bad. After the third gig, Wheeler couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't stomach the idea of another client dropping dead on him. Wheeler cancelled. Called it off. It was over. After the Old Gods comeback tour was cancelled, Wheeler set up a foundation with the money from the record sales of the Greatest Hits album and the gigs. A lot of money. Wheeler was good at his job. Wheeler set up the nursing home facility. The old men deserved it.\n</p>",

A desperate move, but it's better off in pieces than in enemy hands. <a href=\"/wiki/Zachariah_Trench\" title=\"Zachariah Trench\">Trench</a> wouldn't be thrilled. He always said how vital the Nail was, how it was <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control\" title=\"Federal Bureau of Control\">the Bureau's</a> duty to protect it. Bullshit. Those years spent in <a href=\"/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control\" title=\"Director of the Federal Bureau of Control\">the Director's</a> chair warped his priorities. In the end, he valued order over people, the advice of invisible voices over that of <a href=\"/wiki/Bureau_Heads#Management_team\" title=\"Bureau Heads\">old friends</a>. He lost sight of who he was. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Board\" title=\"The Board\">The Board</a> made sure of that. But I did my duty. The Hiss can't corrupt a pile of smoking rubble. My last act as Head of Operations. I'm done. At least I could take those bastards down with me.\n</p>",

I'd bet a year's salary <a href=\"/wiki/The_Board\" title=\"The Board\">the Board</a> sent it. We never did see eye to eye. They have too much <a href=\"/wiki/Control\" title=\"Control\">control</a>.

They make themselves part of every important process. Nothing a little C4 can't fix. Two birds, one bomb. Christ, what a mess. But I stopped <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hiss\" title=\"The Hiss\">the Hiss</a>. I did it. If <a href=\"/wiki/Jesse_Faden\" title=\"Jesse Faden\">Faden</a> did <a href=\"/wiki/Take_Control_(mission)\" title=\"Take Control (mission)\">her part</a> then the Bureau is safe, until the next thing. Jesse has <a href=\"/wiki/Dylan_Faden\" title=\"Dylan Faden\">good reason</a> to hate the Bureau. But that could be what we need right now. She won't follow the same path, won't fall into the same traps. She'll lead her way. So, Director Faden, here's my last lesson: You can't save everybody.\n</p>",
